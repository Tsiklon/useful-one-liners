~~~ Rescan PCI Bus - I.E. Hot adding new hardware etc.
# echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

~~~ Rescan whole SCSI Bus - I.E. adding a new Block device or path and it hasn't been picked up and you don't know where it is (last resort - potentially disruptive) - replace 'hostH' with the HBA in question
# lsscsi
# cat /proc/scsi/scsi  Note;- scsi# is the host to use.

# echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostH/scan  

~~~ Adding a LUN Path non disruptively (DEFINITELY NOT COMPLETE)
where hosth - HBA, c - channel, t - target ID, l - lun
# echo "c t l" > /sys/class/scsi_host/hosth/scan

~~~ Rescan Block Device - I.E a block device has been expanded and you want to read the new capacity
# echo 1 > /sys/block/$DEVICE/device/rescan

~~~ Remove block device - I.E when removing a LUN, or removing a disk from a server
# echo 1 > /sys/block/$DEVICE/device/delete

~~~ Remove PCI device - I.E. nicely removing a hot swappable part.
# lspci | grep -i "whatever device type you want to remove"
# find /sys -name *00:02.0 
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/$PCI-BUS/0000:$DEVICE_ID/remove
